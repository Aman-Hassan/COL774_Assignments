ML Assignments for Semester 1, 2023-24

## **Assignment 1**

- Q1: Batch Gradient Descent
- Q2: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Q3: Logisitic Regression
- Q4: GDA

Not completely done, code and functions could be improved (Probably later, after semeseter maybe)

## **Assignment 2**

- Q1: Test Classificaition using Naive Bayes
  - MultiClass NaiveBayes
  - Random/Positive prediction
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Stemming and other Data Cleaning methods
  - Feature Engineering --> Not implemented
  - Domain Adaptation
-  Q2: Binary Image Classificaion using SVM's
   - CVXOPT Linear Kernel
   - CVXOPT Gaussian Kernel
   - SkLearn Linear/Gaussain Kernel
-  Q3: MultiImage Classification
   - CVXOPT Solver
   - SkLearn Solver
   - Confusion Matrix
   - k-cross Validation

Feature Engineering to be implemented, Data accessing and manipualation can be improved so as to get fast runtimes of algorithms (Prbly later, after semester)
